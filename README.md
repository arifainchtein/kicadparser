<p>
This small utility works in combination with <a href="https://github.com/matthewlai/JLCKicadTools">JLCKicadTools</a> and the  NET file generated by Kicad5 and produce 3 output files:<br>
<ul>
<li> a pin definition file that maps the labels attach to tg=he phiscal pins of the chip to the  Arduino pins. It assumes the chip is AtMega2560.  Furhter version will expand this.</li>
<li>The component report file contains the properties of every symbol in the diagram in table form.</li>
<li>An analysis file that will tell you if a component is not in the cpl but it is in the NET file.  This is very usefull specially if you are using through hole components that are hand soldered by JLCPCB</li>
</ul>
If you are using JLCPCB smt service, and add the two extra fields JLCPC and JLCPCB_TYPE to every symbol, the ComponentReport will include them as well.
<br>
The compnent report will help you verify that every component that needs to be assembled has the C code in the JLCPCB field.  The JLCPCB_TYPE is where you put Basic or Extended and will help you keep track of how many extended components you are using
</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>
You need  maven installed to build .  After cloning, run

mvn package

then 
java -jar kicadparser.jar  path_to_kicad_dot_net_file  component_reference_mcu   path_to_cpl_file_generated_by_JLCKicadTools
<p>
In case you are using a pcb that does not have a MCU then the second parameter must be NoMCU therefore the command must be:<br>

java -jar kicadparser.jar  path_to_kicad_dot_net_file  NoMCU   path_to_cpl_file_generated_by_JLCKicadTools
