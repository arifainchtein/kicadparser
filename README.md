<p>
This small utility will read a NET file generated by Kicad5 and produce 2 output files:<br>
<ul>
<li> a pin definition file that is Arduino compatible and has the mappings of the main MCU to define statements.</li>
<li>The component report file contains the properties of every symbol in the diagram in table form.</li>
</ul>
If you are using JLCPCB smt service, and add the two extra fields JLCPC and JLCPCB_TYPE to every symbol, the ComponentReport will include them as well.
<br>
This report will helpinsure that every component that needs to be assembled has the C code in the JLCPCB field.  The JLCPCB_TYPE is where you put Basic or Extended and will help you keep track of how many extended components you are using
</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>
You need  maven installed to build .  After cloning, run

mvn package

then 
java -jar kicadparser.jar  path_to_kicad_dot_net_file  component_reference_mcu
